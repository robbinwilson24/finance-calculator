## Description: <a name="Description"/>

A simple finance calculator web application that I created with React.js and CSS.  I used Redux to manage the program state. 
I created this to showcase my ability to use React.js, to demonstrate how I used Redux to manage the program state and to demonstrate my ability to create attractively styled projects using CSS. 


## Technologies Used <a name="technologies"/>
This project was created using the following technologies:
   - React.js
   - CSS
   - Redux


## How to use: <a name="how-to"/>
The program starts with an initial monetary value of Â£1000.00. The user is able to perform any of the following actions:
- Deposit funds : By inputting a value into the input field and clicking the deposit button.
- Withdraw funds: By inputting a value into the input field and clicking the withdraw button.
- Add interest: By clicking the "Interest" button (Which will add 5% to the account balance.
- Add charges: By clicking the "Charges" button (Which will deduct 15% from the account balance).

**Note: there is defensive programming in place to stop the account balance from dropping below zero. So, the user will not be able to withdraw more than the account balance.**

5. Once this has finished installing, you can start the game by running the following  in the command line - **"npm start"**.
